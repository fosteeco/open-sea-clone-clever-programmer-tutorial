I attempted to follow a youtube tutorial by Clever Programmer.

Wasn't able to get it up and running completely. Collection page works properly.

The contracts are from https://thirdweb.com/

The Database is something called Sanity which I've never used before but it was pretty easy to figure out.
Can check it out here: https://www.sanity.io/

In the tutorial he was going to use Alchemy for something but he ended up omitting it later in the project.

Also I was really dissapointed with the quality of this tutorial. It was a mess to follow. The dude was saying that he stayed up till 2 AM to finish it so I guess his brain was scrambled by then. Can't blame him. But he's also trying to sell you a course. It felt pretty slimy. He ran through a lot of topics without explaining what they really do. But I think there's some utility in the tutorial but I'd rather watch something else.
